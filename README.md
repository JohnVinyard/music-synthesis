# TODO
- look at different spectrogram scales (and listen to them)
- implement different FFT representations
- understand phase
- FFT representation
- winner's circle

- conjure
- look at tensorboard
- run multi-scale experiment for a while
- organize spectrogram differently, with octaves grouped together
    - `(batch, channels, octave, f0, time)`


# Tools
- better initialization
- experiment report

Starting to investigate whether my choice of frequency scale is causing 
intelligibility problems with the speech I'm trying to generate.  Once I can 
produce clear and intelligible speech, it's time to revisit music and hip-hop 
datasets.
