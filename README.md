# TODO
- understand phase
- FFT representation
- ~~sinc layer~~ *NOT NECESSARY*
- run multi-scale experiment for a while
- low-res MDCT discriminator
- organize spectrogram differently, with octaves grouped together
    - `(batch, channels, octave, f0, time)`


# Tools
- better initialization
- experiment report
